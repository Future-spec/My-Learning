<FONT COLOR=PINK><H2><B><I><DD>The garden that surrounds my house is definitely my favourite place to be. It is peaceful and helps me calm down when life becomes too much to handle. Having a garden, spending time in it and taking care of it have many benefits for everyone regardless of their age or experience.<BR>
It makes you feel proud of yourself for taking care of something so well, it reduces stress, and it also gives you the chance to grow your own fruits and vegetables.<BR>
Moreover, gardening also really helps the environment. By having a lot of greenery around you, it helps improve air quality and also makes the surroundings smell sweet.<BR>
My garden doesn't look large from the outside, but when you're inside, you realize that.<BR>
there are much more plants than you thought. My garden has large trees, shrubs,herbs and gorgeous flowers.
