<p>Indian culture is the heritage of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief systems, political systems, artifacts and technologies that originated in or are associated with the Indian subcontinent. The term also applies beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration, colonization, or influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food and customs differ from place to place within the country.</p><br>

<p>Punjabis celebrate numerous religious and seasonal festivals, such as Dussehra, Diwali, Baisakhi, and many more. There are numerous anniversary celebrations as well in honour of the Gurus (the 10 religious leaders of Sikhism) and various saints. Expressing happiness and gaiety through dance is a typical feature of such festivities, with bhangra, jhumar, and sammi being among the most popular genres. Giddha, a native Punjabi tradition, is a humorous song-and-dance genre performed by women. In addition to Sikh religious music, semi-classical Mughal forms, such as the khyal dance and the thumri, ghazal, and qawwali vocal performance genres, continue to be popular.</p>

<p>Amritsar is the heart-beat of the Majha region which has provided Punjabi literature with its standard language. A launching pad of several renowned artists, authors and poets, the city has been a home of hand-loom and carpet industry for more than a century. The city is proud to have the second largest Milk plant in the country.

Amritsar is not just bhangra or giddha, sarson ka saag and makki ki roti, it is an attitude and a way of life, despite the modern winds blowing, the city still enshrines and exudes its essential cultural identity. Being the only land-route opening to Pakistan the city has become a favourite rendezvous of Track-II diplomacy.</p><br><br>
